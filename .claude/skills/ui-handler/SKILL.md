# UI Handler

## Instructions
- Use `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]` to add new UI components (e.g., `button`, `input`).
- Components are located in `src/components/ui/`.
- Use `cn` utility (from `@/lib/utils`) to merge Tailwind classes.
- Follow the existing design system variables in `globals.css`.
